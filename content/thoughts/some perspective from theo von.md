I was always fascinated by Theo Von. On the one hand, he is this character who unapologetically will say the funniest - but wildest things. On the other, he is one of the genuine people in the world. He isn't afraid to admit vulnerability and openness

***Theo Von on relationships**

[...] I was negative. In a lot of relationships I've been in, I was negative. I didn't want to have fun sometimes... I didn't want to have fun with someone else - especially someone else who loved me. I couldn't - or I didn't want to - somewhere in there, because if I had fun with that person then, it's putting yourself out there, making you vulnerable. Because if you see me having, because if you see me caring about you, then that opens up a lot of risk. 

***Theo Von on "How can I get my husband to stop farting?"***

There's 2 ways you can look at it differently. Yeah, he's farting - that man's got air coming out of his butt. But if you want, that could be a little sound of love. (...) Maybe... every time he does it, you give him a wet fat kiss, maybe you tickle him when he does it (you can have a little cute thing of your own!). 

Don't look at it as something dirty, look at it as something beautiful.
