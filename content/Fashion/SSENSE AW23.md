It's our favorite time of the year again :) - combed through all 444 pages, and listed my personal favorites of this season. 
##### AW2023
| ![[Pasted image 20231221134724.png]] | [Lemaire, Black Hood Beanie](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/lemaire/black-hood-beanie/13798981)<br><br>Not sure if Balaclavas are trendy right now, but I love the anonymity and coziness that a Balaclava gives. This one from Lemaire just ticks all the boxes: nice shape, knit, nice material and warm! |

| ![[Pasted image 20231221134757.png]] | [Lemaire, Black Small Croissant Bag](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/lemaire/black-small-croissant-bag/13795551)<br><br>I've been wanting small leather bag for years now (see Yohji Sling Bag) and this one is just a classic |
| ![[Pasted image 20231221135117.png]] | [Stefan Cooke, Black and White Slashed Derby's](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/stefan-cooke/black-and-white-slashed-derbys/14311281)<br><br>Derby's, but with a twist. Playful, a little pop of color - something for the eccentric |
| ![[Pasted image 20231221135708.png]] | [Balenciaga, Black Cat Eye Sunglasses](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/balenciaga/black-cat-eye-sunglasses/13206341)<br><br>Got these, and the shape just makes you look like a villain - 100% recommend. |
| ![[Pasted image 20231221135732.png]] | [Balenciaga, Silver Oval Sunglasses](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/balenciaga/silver-oval-sunglasses/13205891)<br><br>Likely inspired the things Maison Margiela did when they collaborated with Gentle Monster! Vintage, Y2K-ish look<br> |
| ![[Pasted image 20231221135853.png]] | [Balenciaga, Black Deconstructed Coat](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/balenciaga/black-deconstructed-coat/14350601)<br><br>Just an awesome coat... The oversize, formless shape - elongated sleeves, boxy shoulders, satin lining.. just makes you look like a villain. |
| ![[Pasted image 20231221140213.png]] | [Maison Margiela, Brown Tabi Chelsea Boot](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/maison-margiela/brown-tabi-chelsea-boots/11230341)<br><br>Not sure if this is just a fad for me, but I NEED THESE. This color is especially beautiful in sunlight and the heel elevation is that added detail to make these tabi's more unique - especially on men's. |
| ![[Pasted image 20231221141159.png]] | [Dries Van Noten, Black Zip Jacket](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/dries-van-noten/black-zip-jacket/12027461)<br><br>Lots of pieces from Dries here - love this jacket. Has a defined shape, cropped body with nice and relaxed arms. Also, love the huge collars. |
| ![[Pasted image 20231221141220.png]] | [Dries Van Noten, Black Zip Bomber Jacket](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/dries-van-noten/black-zip-bomber-jacket/10416991)<br><br>Another Dries piece. I feel like military is slowly on the way back. This interpretation is an elevation on the traditional bomber with cool detailing: cropped body, ribless sleeves. A sleek, modern take. |
| ![[Pasted image 20231221142039.png]] | [Xlim, Episode 04-03 Trousers](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/xlim/black-ep4-03-trousers/14428691)<br><br>Brand I discovered in Korea - Emphasizing the shape and the pant-shoe relationship here. |
| ![[Pasted image 20231221141351.png]] | [Dries Van Noten, Blue Striped Shirt](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/dries-van-noten/blue-striped-shirt/10421251)<br><br>See this as a nice layering piece for business-core outfits. |
| ![[Pasted image 20231221143827.png]] | [The Row, Navy Marc Trousers](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/the-row/navy-marc-trousers/12406921)<br><br>In comes the quiet luxury. Lovely material with a classic silhouette. Again, emphasizing the shoe-pant relationship..png]] |
| ![[Pasted image 20231221145738.png]] | [Ann Demeulemeester, Black Ronald Jeans](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/ann-demeulemeester/black-ronald-jeans/13020611)<br><br>The pictures don't it justice, but the color is really unique - somewhat wax-like. Again, the sort of hourglass shape and the shoe-pant relationship are on point. |
| ![[Pasted image 20231221145805.png]] | [Rick Owens, Gray Short Level T-shirt](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/rick-owens/gray-short-level-t-shirt/13452231)<br><br>I need this t-shirt. |
| ![[Pasted image 20231221145901.png]] | [Acne Studios, Brown Fringe Scarf](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/acne-studios/brown-fringe-scarf/13777181)<br><br> |
| ![[Pasted image 20231221150013.png]] | [Maison Margiela, Silver Engraved Ring](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/maison-margiela/silver-engraved-ring/10361141)<br><br>Chrome Hearts-inspired? An everyday elevated ring that will distinguish you from everyone else. Made in brass. |
| ![[Pasted image 20231221150320.png]] | [Dries Van Noten, Black Paneled Mules](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/dries-van-noten/black-paneled-mules/12128391)<br><br>Been addicted with mules recently. Black leather mules for everyday? Easy. |
| ![[Pasted image 20231221150412.png]] | [Clark's, Black Wallabee Loafers](https://www.ssense.com/en-ca/men/product/clarks-originals/black-wallabee-loafers/13683251)<br><br>NEED. THESE. RIGHT. NOW. |
