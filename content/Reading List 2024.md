1. The Captain’s Daughter by Alexander Pushkin 
2. A Hero of Our Time by Mikhael Lermontov 
3. Fathers and Sons by Ivan Turgenev 
4. A collection of Anton Chekhov’s short stories (it doesn’t really matter which one specifically, just read 5-7 of his short stories) 
5. Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy (make sure to get the unabridged version) 
6. The Heart of a Dog by Mikhael Bulgakov (despite the title this is a very clever comedy and a lot of fun) 
7. A Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch or Cancer Ward both by Alexander Solzhenitsyn 
8. War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy (this is not an easy or a fast read but is one of relatively few Russian books where almost everyone lives happily ever after. Penguin also recently released a new translation that’s a lot more readable then the traditional one I strongly recommend it.) 
9. Leaves From a Russian Diary by Pitirim Sorokin. If you can’t find a copy (which is highly likely) then you can substitute Doctor Zhivago by Boris Pasternak 
10. The Brothers Karamazov by Fydor Dostoevsky (it’s simply superb)
