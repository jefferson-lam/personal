Welcome!

I'm Jeff. This is my digital garden of sorts on the Internet where I store notes, insights, and things that interests me.

I'm currently working at the intersection between artificial intelligence and distributed computing at Microsoft. How do we leverage the impact of artificial intelligence with the scale of distributed infrastructure to empower residents of the web?

On a broader level, I care deeply about leveraging technology to create spaces that empower people to grow - creatively, where people are drawn to sharing pieces of their creativity; or technically, where people are inspired to build the next innovation.

This space here is to me an opportunity to share and track my own growth in my creative endeavors. 

Here are some places you may want to visit:

- [The bookshelf on the far wall](/content/books.md): books that currently being read, are read or are to read
- [The film tape on the ground](/content/movies.md): movies that I've been meaning to watch
- [Somewhere, nowhere](content/travels.md): places that I've been to 
- [Ungatekeeping fashion](content/fashion.md): blurbs about anything related to fashion
