I recently visited the Yves Saint Laurent Museum in the heart Marrakech in Morocco, and located right behind the Jardin Majorelle, one of the residences of Yves Saint Laurent.

I got the chance to pick up the book from Studio Ko, the architecture firm that designed the museum and which details the history of its beginnings, and serves as an insight to the latter years of Pierre Bergé, an important figure in the fashion industry.

In 2013, over 1423 days before the eventual opening, Pierre Bergé, long time friend and co-founder of the namesake fashion label, calls Catherine Sabbah to dedicate himself to building a museum dedicated to Yves Saint Laurent in Marrakech. He wanted to create a contemporary Morccan building, rooted in the land that he and Yves Saint Laurent had discovereed together in 1966 and then made their home. 

It seemed like the idea had been in Berge's mind for a long time after a brief visit to the Pierre Berge-Yves Saint Laurent foundation in Paris where storerooms full of archive pieces and extensive models, objects, drawings and reference books - that was a profusion of memories and impressions to be exhibited that would reveal a world yet to be explored.


Over the course of the next 4 years, the museum imagined, planned and designed. They would carefully pick out materials to fit in with the local environments, colors to match the design language of Yves Saint Laurent's vision. 

Today, it houses a beautiful collection of Yves Saint Laurent's earlier, haute couture collection and a variety of beautiful sculptures.

Version 2.

Nestled behind the Jardin Majorelle in Marrakech, the Yves Saint Laurent Museum stands as a tribute to fashion's revolutionary, Yves Saint Laurent, and his partner, Pierre Bergé's, deep ties to Morocco. Conceived by Bergé and brought to life by Studio Ko, this contemporary Moroccan masterpiece celebrates the duo's discovery of Marrakech in 1966—a city that soon became their sanctuary.

The museum's inception dates back to 2013 when Pierre Bergé decided to dedicate a space to Saint Laurent in Marrakech—a city that had captured the couple's hearts since 1966. Marrakech was not just a retreat for them; it was a source of inspiration, a place where the vibrant colors, textures, and landscapes infused their creativity and work.

Drawing from a visit to the Pierre Bergé-Yves Saint Laurent foundation in Paris, where storerooms overflowed with archival pieces, Bergé envisioned a museum that would not only showcase Saint Laurent's revolutionary designs but also serve as a cultural hub that reflected the richness of Moroccan architecture and the spirit of its people.

The construction of the museum was a meticulous process, spanning over four years. Every detail, from the materials chosen to the colors and layout, was thoughtfully selected to harmonize with Marrakech's aesthetic and pay homage to Saint Laurent's innovative design language. The goal was to create a contemporary Moroccan building that felt rooted in the land that had deeply influenced both Saint Laurent and Bergé.

Today, the museum accomplishes that and more. It houses an extensive collection of Saint Laurent's haute couture pieces, each telling a story of groundbreaking creativity and craftsmanship. Alongside these are beautiful sculptures and temporary exhibitions that explore the intersections of fashion, art, and culture.

But more than a museum, this space embodies Bergé's vision of a living, breathing tribute to Saint Laurent's genius—a place where visitors can immerse themselves in the beauty of his creations and the richness of the culture that inspired them. It stands as a bridge between past and present, a source of inspiration for future generations drawn to the art of fashion and the beauty of Moroccan heritage.

The Yves Saint Laurent Museum, materializes the legacy of Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé's profound connection with the city. Initiated by Bergé in 2013, the museum is a nod to their artistic inspiration and aiming to showcase Saint Laurent's influence and Morocco's cultural vibrancy.

The construction, spanning over four years, was a labor of love, emphasizing Moroccan architecture's aesthetics while mirroring Saint Laurent's design principles. Materials and colors were carefully selected to complement the local environment, ensuring the building itself was a tribute to Saint Laurent's vision.

Inside, the museum not only houses an extensive collection of Saint Laurent's pioneering haute couture but also features rotating exhibitions that delve into the intersections of fashion, art, and culture. These expositions are carefully curated to reflect on Saint Laurent's creative genius, offering insights into his design process and the cultural influences that shaped his work.

This museum stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of Yves Saint Laurent and Pierre Bergé's love for Marrakech, serving as a source of inspiration and a cultural landmark that bridges the past, present, and future of fashion and design.
