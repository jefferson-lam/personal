Who is Helmut Lang as an artist?

You might know Helmut Lang as the revolutionary designer who brought the everyday uniform to fashion. You might know him for his denim, his bondage collection, his astro wear or his parkas...

But do you know about his art?

After selling his brand in 2005 to the Prada group, he left fashion entirely to embark on his career as an artist.

Mirroring his work in fashion, his art would often utilize everyday and industrial materials - leveraging the everyday experience to cultivate interesting sculptural forms. [Insert pictures of raw materials] -> [Sculptures]

Notable exhibitions include FOCUS GROUP 2 at von ammon co in Washington DC, **100 Sculptures** at the no gallery in LA and **SMILE** at Halsey Mckay, amongst others.

His most notable collaboration in the art world, however, was with Anthony Vaccarello, the creative director of Yves Saint Laurent at the time. [Show picture of Anthony Vaccarello, his greatest works in sequence]

This project was showcased at the Rive Droite shop in Paris, where Lang transformed Vaccarello's creations into unique sculptures made of fabric, hardware, resin and aluminum. All these materials were recycled from Vaccarello's work in fashion and highlighted the intersection between art and fashion.
