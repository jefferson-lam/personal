Listened to Goggins' perspective on life and discipline.

What's interesting about him is that he is vulnerable, he doesn't pretend to be a mega tough guy. He procrastinates, he complains, he does all this stuff but still manages to power through the effort.

For Goggins', life is psychological warfare. Anything you do is a battle against your inner voice (a theme that comes up a lot in self-help books). Your toughest battles are against yourself - and what makes it challenging it that your inner self knows all of your weaknesses. You have nothing to hide from it. Get out there, do, and win the mental battles.

To quote one of Andrew Huberman's podcasts, the brain develops when one *chooses* to do something they vicariously **do not** want to do. 
##### On regrets 
Goggins' biggest fear in life is the fear that he won't reach his true potential. He pictures a day where judgement happens. He sees himself in front of God: a 300-pound, lazy man. God tells him: are you the ultramarathoner, pushup record, etc. etc. Goggins' responds by saying no - God tells him that's what he could've been.
