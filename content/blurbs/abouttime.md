Yesterday, I flew back to Seattle from Montreal where I spent the holidays seeing family and friends. I normally don't watch movies on the plane - nor movies at all for matter, but decided this time to scroll through the in-flight entertainment. *About Time* caught my eye. 

I have heard about *About Time* before. I believe it was an edit showcasing the final lesson of the movie. I had forgotten what the edit showcased of the movie, but remembered being profoundly moved. I vowed to watch it at some point in my life, but had largely forgotten about it, until I saw it on the plane. 

*About Time* is story about Tom, a largely uninteresting guy who's reality is changed after his father (who is never named) reveals to him that the men in his family tree has and can travel backwards in time. The steps are simple: find a closet, close your eyes, think of the moment you want to travel to, close your fists, and watch yourself be transported. Still immature, Tom first uses this power to go back a few hours to a New Years Party to confidently kiss the girl he fancied in time for the countdown - a move he was too afraid to do the first time around. 

What happens to people who have unlimited tries at life? To people who can replay any moment and see every possibility tree? Tom decides to time travel to find love. 

He meets Mary and falls in love with her. Over the course of the movie, Tom uses time traveling to learn more about Mary - like her interest in Kate Moss. He quotes her while confessing to her: 

> Do you agree that the magic of her lies in her history? That the informality of her early shots compared to this stuff, so you just always know that, despite the high fashion, sheâ€™s still just that cheeky, normal, naked girl on the beach? 

Tom and Mary get married. Dad tells Tom that he loves him, for the first time. Tom and Mary give birth to a girl. 

Soon enough in the movie, the funny moments caused by time traveling is subverted by the tragic events of Tom's family. Tom's sister, lovingly nicknamed Kit Kat, is caught in an abusive relationship. While driving to her niece's birthday, she gets into a car accident which badly hospitalizes her. Tom, against his better judgement, brings Kit Kat back in time such that she never meets her abusive boyfriend. 

As they go back forward in time, Tom is shocked to discover that the child that he had with Mary was not longer a girl, but now a boy. His daughter now replaced by a young stranger who he was supposed to love. His dad tells him that time traveling to a moment before the birth of their child causes their child to be replaced. Time traveling to a moment before a birth sacrifices the child. 

Tom and Mary now have 3 kids. He gets a sudden phone call by his mom. His dad had been diagnosed with lung cancer. Tom rushes back home, where he meets his dad. Seeing Dad's eyes, he realizes that this is not the first time Dad is going through this moment. Dad has been trying to buy more time with his son. 

About Time sets the premise for an emotional delivery: that of the realization of passing time. We sometimes don't realize that moments in our lives pass us by like a flash, turning quickly into memory. We sometimes don't realize that in each moment, even so mundane, there exists a spark. Moments like these are taken for granted. It's human nature. It's like the famous saying: You don't know what you have until you lose it. 

As idealistic and endless the possibilities of time travel are, it diminishes the value of each passing moment. As Tom realizes in the movie, repeating each moment and perfecting it makes you lose touch with the beauty of each passing second. Of the temporality, of the spontaneous. Of the randomness, of the chaos that is life. 

Tom decides ultimately to let go of his time traveling powers. He realizes that the beauty of life lies in experiencing the present as a temporal, fleeting moment. To give it all in the present, and not second-doubt your existence. Do whatever you want to do, and do not take any moment for granted.
