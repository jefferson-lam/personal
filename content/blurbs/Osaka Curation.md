Part of my [Japan Curation List](japan.md)

Some of my stays in Osaka. Stayed here for 5-6 days as a solo traveler, so went to local spots, which would be hard to recommend for trips. But here's the list anyways!

One thing to note is that locals here are so friendly! - much friendlier and genuine than Tokyo.
### Favorite neighborhoods
- Nakazakicho: bohemian neighborhood
- Dotonbori: street food
- Shinsaibashi: place for all the izakayas
### Fashion

For some reason, I found so much more unique items here in Osaka than in Tokyo. My favorite stores, hands-down, are here in Osaka.

**Nibbunoichi**
1-chōme-6-23 Nishishinsaibashi, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 542-0086, Japan

My favorite store in Japan. Unreal curation with archive pieces from, and not limited to Yohji, CDG, Undercover, Rick, Margiela. 

**IRUSE**
Japan, 〒542-0083 Osaka, Chuo Ward, Higashishinsaibashi, 1 Chome−12−3 協栄ビル

The worker here asked me how I found this store when I got here. Has the best collection of archive Jean-Paul Gaultier and Raf Simons I've ever seen in my life. Feels like a small exhibit, and staff are super knowledgable

**AKO**
4 Chome-9-5 Minamisenba, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 542-0081, Japan

More of a punk/edgy feel! And you for sure feel it walking into the store. If you're into Gallery Dept., archive Raf Simons and Undercover, this is the place for you!

### Food

I'm not going to lie, at this point in the trip, I was kind of tired of Japanese food, so a lot of the places I went to are super trashy, but here are some of the good ones I went to! You'll see that most of the places I went to have no reviews.. If you want good restaurants, I wouldn't trust Google Maps because it's all tourists. Switch to Japanese or search on **tabelog**, and anything above 3/5 is good

The musts that you have to eat are **Osaka-style sushi** and **Takoyaki**

**和じ庵**
1 Chome-18-23 Edobori, Nishi Ward, Osaka, 550-0002, Japan

A local recommended me this place, and as soon as I walked in, I felt so out of place... It was filled with old salarymen in suits, but I went fuck-it mode. Nobody spoke english, no english menu, and so I told the staff to just give me whatever and the food here was ungodly. Izakaya with a crazy selection of highballs, wagyu and fresh nigiri

**Oretachino-curry Ramen Koji Labo Osaka-namba**
14-13 Nanbasennichimae, Chuo Ward, Osaka, 542-0075, Japan

I have this place saved, but never went. I think it went viral, looks good though

**Sukiya**
Everywhere

Call me trashy but this place is unreal. Open 24 hours, 7 days. Order in less than 10 seconds and get your meal in less than 30 seconds, for less than 3$. There's a bunch of these around Japan and they serve Gyudon bowls. They call me a Sukiya fiend...

**Family Mart**
Everywhere

When I mean trashy, I literally ate Famichikis for breakfast, lunch and dinner at some point. Sometimes, I dream of Famichikis...

### Cafes and Bakeries

Have to try the Osaka-style Tofu Tiramisu! there's a lot of places in Nakazakicho that have it! Also, careful what sort of cafe you go into, I went into 2 and didn't realize they allowed smoking inside....

**ハウス カレーパンノヒ**
Japan, 〒530-8350 Osaka, Kita Ward, Kakudacho, 8−7 阪急うめだ本店 地下1階

A little hard to find, but this place won the best bakery in West Japan! Unreal curry bread for 500 yen

**KAYA Cafe**
4 Chome-2-13 Nakazakinishi, Kita Ward, Osaka, 530-0015, Japan

The spot where I got my Tofu Tiramisu! Apparently, a favorite amongst locals - pretty empty when I went. Cozy and retro vibe
### Shopping

I was on the hunt for Sonny Angels here (smiskis are way better) so I spent so much time at these stores:

**LOFT Umeda**
16-7 Chayamachi, Kita Ward, Osaka, 530-0013, Japan

**Must: Don Quijote**
Lots of locations, the mega one is this one: 3 Chome-4-36 Ebisuhigashi, Naniwa Ward, Osaka, 556-0002, Japan

The theme song is stuck in my head... roam around and see what kind of stupid stuff you can find here. My favorite section is on the 7th floor behind the curtain
### Attractions
- Osaka Castle: 5/10 - Just a reconstruction
- Osaka TeamLabs Park: 7/10 - Super out the way and it was ok, nothing crazy, if you like outdoor exhibits with lights though, this is def for you
- Universal Studios: Didn't go but def will go next time 
- Dotonbori: yes! lots of places to eat
