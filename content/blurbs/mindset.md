[Message of this piece will be the steps needed to change from a fixed mindset to a growth mindset.]

I love the quote from Dune about fear. Maybe insert it here?

[Write paragraph about Baron, my fixed-mindset alter ego, and what triggers it. View ch. 8 of book as inspiration]

Example (p.258-259). Failure, especially public failure, is my main fixed-mindset trigger. That's when Henrietta comes out. She is my critical grand-mother, and in the fixed mindset I remind myself more of her than I'd care to admit. My Henrietta persona is quick to blame others to preserve her ego. She rejects failure instead of embracing it, and makes me worry that if anyone ever sees me fail they will deem me a failure.
